## 🚀 Project Setup Instructions

This project requires **Python 3.9+**. Follow these steps to set up a reproducible environment.

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
Isolate the project dependencies by creating a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate the Environment
- **macOS / Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 3. Install Pinned Dependencies
Install the exact versions of the required ML libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Machine Learning Pipeline
Execute the full workflow (ingestion, preprocessing, training, and evaluation):
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=.
python3 src/main.py
```

### 5. Verification
To verify the setup, you can check the installed versions:
```bash
pip list
```

### 6. Deactivate
Exit the environment when finished:
```bash
deactivate
```

## 🏗️ Engineering Principles

- **Modular Design**: Every stage of the ML lifecycle is isolated into its own module.
- **Function Contracts**: All functions use type hints and descriptive docstrings.
- **No Hidden State**: Configuration is centralized in `config.py` and passed explicitly.
- **Reproducibility**: Random seeds are controlled via `RANDOM_STATE` in configuration.
- **Persistence**: Both the model and the preprocessing pipeline are saved for consistent inference.

## 📂 Repository Structure Explanation

- **`data/`**: Separated into `raw/` for immutable ground-truth data and `processed/` for cleaned features. This ensures that the original data is never accidentally modified.
- **`src/`**: Contains the production-ready source code. Each module has a single responsibility (e.g., `train.py` only handles fitting).
- **`models/`**: Dedicated storage for serialized model and preprocessing artifacts, keeping them separate from source code.
- **`notebooks/`**: Reserved for exploration, visualization, and EDA. Production logic is strictly kept in `src/`.
- **`reports/`**: Stores evaluation outputs like metric logs and plots, facilitating experiment comparison.
- **`logs/`**: Tracks pipeline execution and experiment history to support reproducibility.

## 🔄 Data Flow Mapping

The project follows a unidirectional data flow to prevent leakage and ensure maintainability:

1. **Ingestion**: Raw data is loaded from `data/raw/` via `data_preprocessing.py`.
2. **Cleaning**: Initial cleaning (handling missing values) is performed, and data is split into train/test sets.
3. **Feature Engineering**: `feature_engineering.py` constructs a `ColumnTransformer` pipeline.
4. **Training**: `train.py` fits the model on the preprocessed training features.
5. **Evaluation**: `evaluate.py` assesses the model on the test set and outputs metrics to `reports/`.
6. **Persistence**: `persistence.py` saves the fitted model and pipeline to `models/`.
7. **Prediction**: `predict.py` loads artifacts from `models/` and transforms new data for inference.

## 🧠 Design Justification

### Separation of Raw and Processed Data
Raw data is treated as immutable. By keeping it separate from processed data, we ensure that any feature engineering step can be discarded or re-run without risking the loss of the original source of truth. This is critical for data auditing and reproducibility.

### Separation of Notebooks and Source Code
Notebooks are excellent for exploration but poor for version control and testing. By moving stable logic into modular Python files in `src/`, we make the codebase testable, reusable, and ready for deployment.

### Artifact Management outside Source
Models and pipelines are binaries that change every time we re-train. Keeping them in a dedicated `models/` folder prevents the `src/` directory from being bloated with non-code artifacts and allows for better versioning of model files.

### Centralized Configuration (`config.py`)
Hardcoding paths and hyperparameters across multiple files creates a maintenance nightmare. `config.py` acts as a single point of truth, making it easy to move data locations or update seeds without hunting through the entire codebase.
